# Houdini + PyTorch Digit Recognition
Simple ML digit recognition in SideFX Houdini using PyTorch and Numpy


### Demo:

### Dependencies:
- Houdini 19 py3
- Python  3.7.4
- PyTorch 1.10.0 
- Numpy   1.21.3
- cuda    11.3.1
- cudnn   11.3

### Scripts:
All of the scripts are implemented internally in Houdini's python nodes. The .py files are just for quick code access without having to open Houdini.

### Disclaimer:
There are probably a lot of rookie mistakes and many ways to do things smarter and more efficiently. Keep that in mind when digging into it! =)
